# HW-Video-Gamma-vs.-Brightness

In modern Digital Video,
LED screens, TVs or Monitor.

There is a Gamma and Brightnes setting among others...

because LED screens have certain limits vs. OLED for example or vs. TN panels,
Video configuration is usually the same between diferent HW,

Contrast at 100% or near, some Tvs like 90%, others 92%, others 95%, others 98%, some 100%.

Brightness is usually between 30% and 40%,
Brighness level depends if you are looking the TV / Monitor in a Dark Room or in Day Light.
Far or Close.
The best way to set Brightness level is usually looking a video with a Black Background Near RGB 0,0,0.
if the Dark background becomes visible Brigtness setting is too much.

LED BackLight setting also depends if viewed in Dark Room or Day Light.
Eco Mode usually limits BackLight.

Some Tvs / Monitors have Side BackLight,
this is for True BackLight, No Side-Light Panels.

Â¿what does Gamma setting have to do with all this...?
Most people set Gamma at 0 and forget about it, but when is a true HW Gamma,
Gamma has a similar effect as Brightness.
but Not the same.

IF HW Gamma is set to -2,
Brigtness level can be increased +10%, near 50%.
image will look similar, but will have a very interesting side-effect.

Allows bright lights spots in the image to become brighter, to have a higher dynamic range, 
like Real Life,
if you measure Sun Light with a HW Lux Lumen Meter,
you will see light can change drastically from 1000 lumens, "the lowerst" for a small CCD/CMOS sensor camera.
to 10k lumens, the minimum required in Schools in Asia,
up to 120k Lumens in a Sunny Day.

Big sensors are better for Low Light, 
Small sensors are better for Bright Light,
Big Sensors require Filters to Stop light when mneasuring Bright Light, 
usually made of Black Matte Anodized Aluminum, with small holes in the center to allow light to pass to the center of the sensor.
Emulate reducing the size of the sensor physically.

Anyway...
When HW Gamma is set -2 and Brightenss increased to compensate,
you will feel the same Eye pain when looking a Bright Window from a Dark Room,
that can be annoying yes, if the Music video has those scenes.
same pain,
but... in some situations, TV looks much more real,
for example: a Disco Mirror Ball, reflected bright spots in the walls of a Video, look much more real, like if you are there.
Bright spots / small lights in Dark Scenes look much more real, 
does Not cause pain to the Eyes if the area is Not Big Enough, like a Window looking the Sun.

Software Gamma is very different, and limited by real HW Gamma. Useless for this purpose.

Increasing Gamma +2 and reduce Brightness -10% to 20% will compress the dynamic-range of the light, making the opposite effect, 
feeling very unrealistic, very unnatural.

If you want more real image with the TV you already have, Now you know.
If you want to avoid the Eye pain in some scenes,
a less drastic settings like -1 Gamma and +5% Brightness, can also work.
